# If you need to add some library to your lambda, you need to do 
# some extra work. 
# Here is how I added redis/valkey to my lambda. valkey is an open source dropin
# replacement for redis, so you can use the redis-api.

# Have to make sure that the lambda can access the VPC where valkey is.

# https://dev.to/giftcup/how-to-connect-aws-lambda-to-an-amazon-elasticache-redis-cluster-5d9j
# Simplest to (1) Setup ValKey and then (2) Create the lambda on the VPC holding the ValKey cluster.

mkdir lambdaValkey
cd lambdaValkey/
vim lambda_function.py # put your lambda here, you can edit it later in the console as well
rm -fr deployment_package.zip
rm -fr packages
mkdir packages
pip install --target ./packages redis
cd packages/
zip -r ../deployment_package.zip .
cd ..
zip deployment_package.zip lambda_function.py
# Now upload this to your lambda
