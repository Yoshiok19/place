bThere is a lot to setup here to make this work

1) apigateway with a websocket, you need the URL of the websocket server (put this in echo.html and scribble.html)
2) Lambdas as outlined here
3) The apigateway can be the triggers for the lambdas as appropriate. Configure the appropriate
   methods for each of 
	Connect.py     Method: $connect
	Disconnect.py  Method: $disconnect
	SendMessage.py Method: sendMessage

	Broadcast.py   Exercise: You will need to figure this out below.

4) Put the URL of the websocket server in echo.html and scribble.html
5) You can just load these into firefox, or figure out how to serve echo.html and scribble.html from AWS
6) Exercise: Figure out how to make Broadcast.py work, note the message we send to the web socket
   from echo.html and scribble.html and also the fact that SendMessage.py gets called.
