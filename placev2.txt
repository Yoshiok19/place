1. Create VPC
2. Create Redis OSS on VPC through Elasticache (optional: Add all 3 availability zones)
3. Create WebSocket API on API Gateway and add routes
    - Create $connect route
    - Create $disconnect route
    - Create sendMessage route
4. Create lambdas on VPC
    - Create connect lambda
    - Create disconnect lambda
    - Create receiveMessage lambda
    - Configure the integration request for each route to point to the appropriate lambda function
    - Check that each lambda has the appropriate trigger (The corrent API Gateway route)
    - Make sure each Lambda has a role with the required permissions set (S3FullAccess, AWSLambdaVPCAccess, ApiGatewayAccess, etc.)
5. Create S3 bucket and place base canvas.png
    - Go to VPC -> Endpoints and create a s3 endpoint. (Need this for lambda to access s3 on VPC)


Notes:
- Make sure to attach the appropraite roles to everything(S3 access for lambda, CloudWatch for API Gateway for logging, etc.)
